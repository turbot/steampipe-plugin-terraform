# Terraform + Steampipe

A Terraform configuration file is used to declare resources, variables, modules, and more.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query data using SQL.

Query all resources in your Terraform files:

```sql
select
  name,
  type,
  jsonb_pretty(arguments) as args
from
  terraform_resource;
```

```
> select name, type, jsonb_pretty(arguments) as args from terraform_resource;

## Documentation

- **[Table definitions & examples â†’](/plugins/turbot/terraform/tables)**

## Get started

### Install

Download and install the latest Terraform plugin:

```bash
steampipe plugin install terraform
```

### Credentials

No credentials are required.

### Configuration

Installing the latest terraform plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/terraform.spc`) with a single connection named `terraform`:

```hcl
connection "terraform" {
  plugin = "terraform"

  # Paths is a list of locations to search for Terraform configuration files
  # All paths are resolved relative to the current working directory (CWD)
  # Wildcard based searches are supported, including recursive searches

  # For example:
  #  - "*.tf" matches all Terraform configuration files in the CWD
  #  - "**/*.tf" matches all Terraform configuration files in the CWD and all sub-directories
  #  - "../*.tf" matches all Terraform configuration files in the CWD's parent directory
  #  - "steampipe*.tf" matches all Terraform configuration files starting with "steampipe" in the CWD
  #  - "/path/to/dir/*.tf" matches all Terraform configuration files in a specific directory
  #  - "/path/to/dir/main.tf" matches a specific file

  # If paths includes "*", all files (including non-Terraform configuration files) in
  # the CWD will be matched, which may cause errors if incompatible file types exist

  # Defaults to CWD
  paths = [ "*.tf" ]
}
```

- `paths` - A list of directory paths to search for Terraform files. Paths are resolved relative to the current working directory. Paths may [include wildcards](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match) and also support `**` for recursive matching. Defaults to the current working directory.
