# Terraform + Steampipe

A Terraform configuration file is used to declare resources, variables, modules, and more.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query data using SQL.

Query all resources in your Terraform files:

```sql
select
  name,
  type,
  jsonb_pretty(arguments) as args
from
  terraform_resource;
```

```
> select name, type, jsonb_pretty(arguments) as args from terraform_resource;

## Documentation

- **[Table definitions & examples â†’](/plugins/turbot/terraform/tables)**

## Get started

### Install

Download and install the latest Terraform plugin:

```bash
steampipe plugin install terraform
```

### Credentials

No credentials are required.

### Configuration

Installing the latest terraform plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/terraform.spc`) with a single connection named `terraform`:

```hcl
connection "terraform" {
  plugin = "terraform"

  # Paths is a list of locations to search for Terraform configuration files
  # All paths are resolved relative to the current working directory (CWD)
  # Wildcard based searches are supported, including recursive searches
  # Defaults to CWD
  paths = [ "*.tf" ]
}
```

### Setting up paths

The argument `paths` in the config is flexible in being able to search Terraform configuration files from a number of different sources (i.e. directory paths, Git, S3, etc.). This removes the burden of knowing how to download from a variety of sources from the implementer.

Paths supports the following protocols:

- [Local files](#configuring-local-file-paths)
- [Remote repositories](#configuring-remote-repositories-urls)
- [S3](#configuring-s3-urls)

Paths may [include wildcards](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match) and also support `**` for recursive matching. Defaults to the current working directory. For example:

```hcl
connection "terraform" {
  plugin = "terraform"

  paths = [
    "*.tf",
    "~/*.tf",
    "github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-aws//aws-test/tests/aws_acm_certificate//*.tf",
    "github.com/hashicorp/terraform-guides//infrastructure-as-code//**/*.tf",
    "git::https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-alicloud.git//alicloud-test/tests/alicloud_account//*.tf",
    "bitbucket.org/benturrell/terraform-arcgis-portal//modules/shared//*.tf",
    "gitlab.com/YourProject/YourRepository//YourFolder//*.tf",
    "s3::https://bucket.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/terraform_examples//**/*.tf"
  ]
}
```

#### Configuring local file paths

You can define a list of local directory paths to search for terraform files. Paths are resolved relative to the current working directory. For example:

- `*.tf` matches all Terraform configuration files in the CWD.
- `**/*.tf` matches all Terraform configuration files in the CWD and all sub-directories.
- `../*.tf` matches all Terraform configuration files in the CWD's parent directory.
- `steampipe*.tf` matches all Terraform configuration files starting with "steampipe" in the CWD.
- `/path/to/dir/*.tf` matches all Terraform configuration files in a specific directory. For example:
  - `~/*.tf` matches all Terraform configuration files in the home directory.
  - `~/**/*.tf` matches all Terraform configuration files recursively in the home directory.
- `/path/to/dir/main.tf` matches a specific file.

```hcl
connection "terraform" {
  plugin = "terraform"

  paths = [ "*.tf", "~/*.tf", "/path/to/dir/main.tf" ]
}
```

**NOTE:** If paths includes `*`, all files (including non-Terraform configuration files) in the CWD will be matched, which may cause errors if incompatible file types exist.

#### Configuring remote repositories URLs

Not only local files, but you can also configure `paths` with any remote repository URLs (i.e. GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab) to search various Terraform configuration files in it.

You can also mention [wildcards](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match) and also support `**` for recursive matching. For example:

- `github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-aws//*.tf` matches all top-level Terraform configuration files in the specified repository.
- `github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-aws//**/*tf` matches all Terraform configuration files in the specified repository and all sub-directories.
- `github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-aws?ref=fix_7677//**/*tf` matches all Terraform configuration files in the specific tag of repository.

If you want to download only a specific subdirectory from a downloaded directory, you can specify a subdirectory after a double-slash (`//`).

```hcl
connection "terraform" {
  plugin = "terraform"

  paths = [ "github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-aws//aws-test/tests/aws_acm_certificate//*.tf" ]
}
```

Similarly, you can also define a list of GitLab and BitBucket URLs to search for the Terraform configuration files.

```hcl
connection "terraform" {
  plugin = "terraform"

  paths = [
    "github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-aws//**/*tf",
    "github.com/hashicorp/terraform-guides//infrastructure-as-code//**/*.tf",
    "bitbucket.org/benturrell/terraform-arcgis-portal//modules/shared//*.tf",
    "bitbucket.org/benturrell/terraform-arcgis-portal//modules//**/*.tf",
    "gitlab.com/YourProject/YourRepository//YourFolder//*.tf",
    "gitlab.com/YourProject/YourRepository//**/*.tf"
  ]
}
```

You can also use the below URL format to query the files stored inside remote repositories:

- `git::https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-alicloud.git//alicloud-test/tests/alicloud_account//*.tf`
- `git::github.com/hashicorp/terraform-guides//infrastructure-as-code//**/*.tf`
- `git::bitbucket.org/benturrell/terraform-arcgis-portal//modules/shared//*.tf`
- `git::gitlab.com/YourProject/YourRepository//YourFolder//*.tf`

#### Configuring S3 URLs

As a part of reading files from remote, you can also query all Terraform configuration files stored inside a S3 bucket (public or private) using the URL. For example:

##### Accessing a private bucket

Using this plugin, you can query the files inside a private S3 bucket. S3 takes various access configurations in the URL. For example:

- `aws_access_key_id` - AWS access key.
- `aws_access_key_secret` - AWS access key secret.
- `aws_access_token` - AWS access token if this is being used.
- `aws_profile` - Use this profile from local `~/.aws/config`. Takes priority over the other three.

You can use any of the above credential option in the URL path to authenticate your request. For example:

```hcl
connection "terraform" {
  plugin = "terraform"

  paths = [
    "bucket-1.s3.amazonaws.com/test_folder?aws_access_key_id=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY>&aws_access_key_secret=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET>&region=<region-code>//*.tf",
    "bucket-2.s3.amazonaws.com/test_folder?aws_profile=<AWS_PROFILE>&region=<region-code>//*.tf"
  ]
}
```

You can also use the below URL format to query the files stored inside remote repositories:

- `bucket-1.s3-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/test_folder?aws_profile=<AWS_PROFILE>//**/*.tf`
- `s3::bucket-1.s3.amazonaws.com/test_folder/test.tf?aws_profile=<AWS_PROFILE>&region=us-east-1`

**NOTE:**

By default the bucket owner has has full control over the objects in it. If you are not the owner of the bucket that you are trying to query, ask the owner to update the bucket policy with the required access. To run the query you will need a basic read access for bucket and object. You can refer the sample bucket policy mentioned below:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadBucket",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/YOUR_USER"
      },
      "Action": ["s3:ListBucket"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::test-bucket1"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/YOUR_USER"
      },
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:GetObjectVersion"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::test-bucket1/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Also, make sure the credentials/profile passed in the URL are valid, otherwise, the query will fail with an error code `403`.

##### Accessing a public bucket

You can query any public S3 bucket directly using the URL without passing any credentials. For example:

```hcl
connection "terraform" {
  plugin = "terraform"

  paths = [
    "s3::bucket-1.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/test_folder//*.tf",
    "s3::bucket-2.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/test_folder//**/*.tf"
  ]
}
```

You can also use the below URL format to query the files stored inside remote repositories:

- `s3::https://bucket-1.s3-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/test_folder//**/*.tf`
- `s3::https://bucket-1.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/test.tf`
