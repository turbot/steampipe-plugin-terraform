# Terraform + Steampipe

A Terraform configuration file is used to declare resources, variables, modules, and more.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query data using SQL.

Query data from the `my_users.tf` file:

```sql
select
  name,
  type,
  arguments
from
  terraform_resource;
```

## Documentation

- **[Table definitions & examples â†’](/plugins/turbot/terraform/tables)**

## Get started

### Install

Download and install the latest Terraform plugin:

```bash
steampipe plugin install terraform
```

### Credentials

No credentials are required.

### Configuration

Installing the latest terraform plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/terraform.spc`) with a single connection named `terraform`:

```hcl
connection "terraform" {
  plugin = "terraform"
  paths  = [ "/path/to/your/files/*.tf" ]
}
```

- `paths` - A list of directory paths to search for Terraform files. Paths may [include wildcards](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match). File matches must have the extension `.tf` (case insensitive).
